# Instrument presentation

The Fibered Imager foR a Single Telescope (FIRST) is a spectro-interferometer operating in the visible wavelengths at a resolution of about 4,000. It is fed by the SCExAO system. FIRST was developed in collaboration with the Paris Observatory.

FIRST feeds a Photonic Lantern device from a focal plane. The Photonic Lantern consists of a multi-mode input slowly transitioning into 19 Single-mode fibers. The multi-mode inputâ€™s core has a diameter of 25 micrometers.

*Figure 1: Photonic Lantern hardware. The input is a multi-mode fiber, and the outputs are 19 single mode fibers spliced into a V-groove*


The 19 outputs of the Photonic Lantern feed a mid resolution spectrograph (R~4,000), optimized for wavelengths ranging from 620 nm to 780 nm. The spectrograph is equipped with a wollaston, allowing to split the polarization for each output, providing a total of 38 spectra (see below). More information on the instrument and its integration on SCExAO are available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15412).
